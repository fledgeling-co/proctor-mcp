# ORCHESTRATOR — Proctor remaining-work plan & ledger

**Status:** In Progress — wave 3 planned, awaiting go-ahead
**Updated:** 2026-08-14 — wave 1+2 remain MERGED (10 features, local `main`). Wave 3 added: the run-HUD line of work (4 briefs) plus the 3 security/follow-up items scheduled on 2026-08-13 and still untriaged. 173 tests / 24 suites green @ 2e478ec.

### Corrections to earlier rows (reconciled 2026-08-14)
- **This repo DOES now have a git remote** (`origin` → github.com/fledgeling-co/proctor-mcp). The earlier "no git remote, main is LOCAL-ONLY" note is stale. Local `main` is **4 commits AHEAD** of `origin/main` and those commits carry unreviewed WIP: **merge to local `main` only, never push.**
- Worktrees branch from **local HEAD**, set via `.claude/settings.local.json` (`worktree.baseRef: head`), because `origin/main` does not contain the design artifacts wave 3 depends on.
- The agent-panel rendering blocker that gated the run HUD is **FIXED** at `2e478ec` (one panel per screen; the union panel's 26Mpx backing store is accepted by the window server and never presented). Its brief has been deleted from `docs/features-to-triage/`.

## How to resume
You are the fleet orchestrator (ship-fleet skill). Read this file top to bottom, reconcile
the ledger below against reality (`docs/feature-specs/LEDGER.md`, `docs/specs/*`,
`git worktree list`, merged branches), correct drifted rows, then continue filling slots. Rules:
- ≤ **3** concurrent runners (user-chosen, 2026-08-13); an item starts only when every "Depends on" ID has **MERGED**.
- Runners are Opus agents (launched via the verified single-agent-Workflow lane, `model:'opus'`,
  `effort:'high'`, `agentType:'claude'`) that invoke the ship-feature skill and **STOP BEFORE MERGE**;
  the orchestrator serializes all finalization (rebase → gate → merge → worktree cleanup) one branch at a time.
- **This repo has no git remote — `main` is LOCAL-ONLY. "Merge" means merge to local `main`; never push.**
- Serial-only shared writes: `LEDGER.md` (id allocation, done), this file (orchestrator is sole writer),
  the `Sources/` tool catalogue (all items touch it → serialize at merge), integration-branch merges.

### Swift adaptation (this repo is NOT a Diolog web app)
- `proctor-mcp` is a **Swift Package**. The acceptance gate is **`swift build` + `swift test`** (new tests
  per acceptance clause), NOT Playwright e2e.
- **Skip** ship-feature's web-only stages: design-craft/DESIGN.md, `design/mocks/html`, mockup-fidelity,
  Playwright acceptance-e2e. There is **no customer-facing UI**; every feature is backend MCP/AX/AppleEvents/SCK work.
- Best-practices context (no CODING_PRACTICES.md here): `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and the existing
  `Sources/ProctorCore` / `ProctorReflector` patterns are the engineering authority.
- Verification is NOT dropped — it is Swift-shaped: typed acceptance evidence = a red→green `swift test`
  per acceptance clause, plus the affected-test sweep. Never ship "verified by code reading".

### External model CLIs — READ THIS BEFORE EVERY EXTERNAL CALL
Superseded 2026-08-14 by the reader's explicit choice. The 2026-08-13 line
(`external-model-clis: off`, Codex relay down) no longer describes this repo.

- **Codex / `gpt-5.6-sol`: OFF.** Do not invoke it, for gates or for executor slices. Not a
  fallback, not for a retry.
- **The three out-of-family review gates run on GROK instead** — the triage spec review, the plan
  review gate, and work Phase D's completeness critic. Verified working on this machine
  2026-08-14 (read a real repo file and returned its content accurately):

  ```
  perl -e 'alarm shift @ARGV; exec @ARGV' 240 \
    grok -p "<prompt>" --model grok-4.6 --effort xhigh --sandbox read-only
  ```

  `grok 1.0.3`, logged in to grok.com, `grok-4.6` is the default model. `-p` is single-turn and
  prints to stdout. An **empty or absent response is a LANE FAILURE, not a pass** — on any failure
  the gate falls back **in-family with a logged downgrade in the artifact**, never to Codex and
  never silently skipped.
- **Executor slices stay in-family.** Grok is seated as the independent *reviewer* only; there is no
  cheap-executor lane on this run.
- **Egress warning, and it is load-bearing for two items in this wave.** A grok call transmits the
  artifact and every source file it opens to xAI. PRO-0012 (policy gate + audit) and PRO-0013
  (audit-log encryption-at-rest) are security features. The reader chose this lane knowing that;
  do not widen it beyond the three named gates.

## Wave plan
Wave 1 (no unmerged internal deps — 8 slots): PRO-0001 CUA façade, PRO-0002 set-of-marks, PRO-0003 menu-bar
  shortcuts, PRO-0004 app-dictionary, PRO-0005 audit+policy, PRO-0006 capture-normalisation, PRO-0007 zoom,
  PRO-0008 MCP-surface.
Wave 2 (after their dep merges): PRO-0009 process-kill+fs-jail (soft after PRO-0008 — annotation/gating
  conventions), PRO-0010 pointer-overlay (after PRO-0002 — shared overlay path).
Wave 3 (2026-08-14, reader chose the full backlog — all 7): the run HUD line PRO-0014 → PRO-0015 →
  {PRO-0016, PRO-0017}, run alongside the three items scheduled 2026-08-13 and never triaged
  (PRO-0011 stability pointer marker, PRO-0012 re-gate flow/stability, PRO-0013 audit encryption).
  The three carry no dependency on the HUD line or on each other, so they fill slots freely.
  IDs 0014-0017 are allocated at pre-triage, serially, under the ledger lock.

Holding pen (external deps / needs input): none.

### Wave 3 dependency order
- **PRO-0014 step descriptions** — independent. Pure agent logic, no window. Goes first.
- **PRO-0015 run HUD panel** — after PRO-0014 (needs its derived descriptions for the live line).
  Design is SETTLED and binding: `mocks/run-hud.html` is the rendered reference, with
  `docs/design/run-hud-queue.md` and `docs/design/run-hud-character.md` as the specs. Do NOT re-open
  the design and do NOT run design-craft on it. The HUD is a borderless NSPanel from the agent
  process and MUST follow the one-panel-per-screen rule; the header comment in
  `Sources/ProctorAgent/Overlay/CursorOverlay.swift` explains why, with the measurement.
- **PRO-0016 multi-session queue** — scheduler half is independent of the UI; the queue UI is after
  PRO-0015. Spec: `docs/design/run-hud-queue.md`, whose open questions triage should settle rather
  than leave to the implementer.
- **PRO-0017 HUD character assets** — after PRO-0015. Design settled; scope is asset production and
  binding, not choosing a character.
- **PRO-0011/0012/0013** — independent of the HUD line and of each other. 0012 and 0013 are security.

## Deferred children discovered mid-fleet

## Needs input (consolidated for the user)
- **Runner model was Opus 4.8, not Opus 5.** Every runner self-checked as `claude-opus-4-8[1m]` at high effort; the fleet convention names `claude-opus-5`, which is not the model actually served on this machine. All work is gated green (build + red→green tests per clause), so this did not degrade the run — flagging only so the convention string can be corrected if desired.
- **Three deferred children above** are logged, not scheduled. Say if you want any promoted to a new fleet item.

## Event log (append-only, newest first)
- 2026-08-14 UI: permission-state fix + always-on menu bar + live activity + quit-everything + mock redesign. Three problems from real use, all fixed. (1) **Permission bug:** the window polled the agent with `tool:"doctor"` but dispatch only matches `"proctor_doctor"`, so every check read "agent not answering" even with both grants on — one-line fix in `AgentModel.swift`; verified by socket probe (`proctor_doctor` ok + grants, bare `doctor` = unknown tool). Granting Screen Recording now kickstarts the agent so its cached `SCShareableContent` probe re-runs, with an "Applying…" transient. Dropped the stale `~/Applications` reveal-and-drag copy (now `/Applications`, listed in the picker). (2) **Menu bar always-visible:** app registers as a login item via `SMAppService.mainApp` and both installers (`install.sh`, `Install.swift`) `open` the app after loading the agent; polling moved to app-lifetime (model `init`) so the menu stays live with the window closed; login start is quiet (window `orderOut`). (3) **Live activity:** ring buffer `(tool, at, ok)` + in-flight marker on the `Session` actor, recorded at the `Dispatcher.handle` choke point, tracked set derived from `ToolCatalogue` (so health polls, internal verbs, and unknown tools are all excluded automatically — caught a leak during verify where a stale UI's bare-`doctor` polls flooded the feed). Exposed as internal `proctor_recent_activity` (NOT in ToolCatalogue); rendered in the menu line + a status-window Activity card. (4) **Quit = everything:** `applicationWillTerminate` boots out the agent on every quit path; label "Quit Proctor". Both return at next login. Native look kept; mock's motion implemented in SwiftUI (`Motion.swift`: spring `cubic-bezier(.32,.72,0,1)`, step slide, dot-fill keyframe, grant-success pop+ring, status-pill spring-in) all gated on Reduce Motion. Mock `mocks/onboarding-and-menu.html` redesigned as the design source (Codex-register hero sheet, 3 dots, live-activity surfaces, de-staled). **Verified live** (signed Developer ID reinstall, grants survived the same-identity rebuild): runtime `tools/list` = 19, internal verbs hidden, doctor reflects grants (ready), activity feed excludes polls and captures real tools. Not machine-witnessable here (obscura is web-only): the native app's visual/animation fidelity and the login-item/quit GUI paths — code-complete against the mock, need a human glance.
- 2026-08-14 Install relocated to /Applications + notarised-by-default + CI release pipeline + CHANGELOG. install.sh now installs to `/Applications` (was `~/Applications`; sudo fallback), auto-detects the Developer ID identity, and notarises fresh builds by default (keychain profile `proctor`; `PROCTOR_SKIP_NOTARIZE=1` to skip). uninstall.sh + README follow the path change. notarize.sh generalised to accept an ASC API key via env (`NOTARY_KEY`/`NOTARY_KEY_ID`/`NOTARY_ISSUER_ID`) for CI alongside the local keychain-profile path. Added `.github/workflows/release.yml`: on a `v*` tag it imports the Developer ID cert into a temp keychain, builds+signs, notarises+staples via ASC API key, packages, extracts the matching CHANGELOG section, and publishes the GitHub release (6 repo secrets documented in the header). CHANGELOG.md created (Keep a Changelog; v0.1.0 entry written via create-luke-content, lint clean). **Live relocation performed:** booted out the old `~/Applications` agent, installed the already-stapled build to `/Applications` (reused, no rebuild), agent running, doctor clean, runtime `tools/list` = 19, Gatekeeper Accepted/Notarized. Grants did NOT carry: prior install was ad-hoc, so the new Developer ID identity is a fresh TCC identity needing a one-time manual re-grant (Accessibility + Screen Recording) — panes opened; future upgrades keep the identity and will survive. Left uncommitted + flagged: stale `design/icon/build_icon.py` + `design/icon/icon-proctor.svg` working changes from the icon rounds (unrelated to this request).
- 2026-08-13 Icon finalised = raster C. Reader judged the GPT-Image raster take (proctor-raster-7c3d62-2, glowing glass-gel cubes) decisively better than the hand-authored SVG master even after 4+ fidelity rounds ("C wins by a landslide") — the known vector-can't-out-material-a-diffusion-raster ceiling. Shipped the raster directly: squircle-masked via design/icon/apply-squircle.sh (reproducible) into app-icon-shaped source art, verified legible at 16/32/48px. App rebuilt + re-notarised (Accepted) + stapled; v0.1.0 asset replaced (4.58MB); site icons regenerated (Pages redeploys). Tradeoff: shipped icon is now the raster, not the parametric SVG — future tweaks need a new generation/pixel edit, not a build_icon.py param. SVG master kept as superseded provenance. Local reinstall still the reader's step.
- 2026-08-13 App icon designed + shipped. The site's existing mark was illegible at 16-32px (cream-on-cream windows). Re-materialised via create-mac-icon (12/12 audit): a deep-graphite window with a terracotta pixel-dissolve "actuation edge" on warm paper — brand DNA kept, small-size legibility fixed (verified 16/32/48px). Source art committed at Apps/Proctor/icon-1024.png; build-app.sh now generates Proctor.icns from it. App rebuilt + re-notarised (Accepted) + stapled; v0.1.0 release asset replaced with the icon'd build (0 downloads, identical code). Site icons regenerated to match (auto-redeploys Pages). Editable SVG master under design/icon/ (heavy iteration provenance gitignored). Local reinstall to see the icon in Finder remains the reader's step.
- 2026-08-13 NOTARISED + RELEASED. Fresh Developer ID build from main (verified 19 tools via runtime tools/list, not the unreliable `strings` oracle), notarised (Apple: Accepted, submission a3c39364), stapled, Gatekeeper-accepted. Published as GitHub release **v0.1.0** on fledgeling-co/proctor-mcp with `Proctor-0.1.0.zip` (1.92MB, stapled). Build-only — the running local agent was NOT reinstalled (reader chose "you run the install"); its rebuild + one-time re-grant remains theirs. App still ships without an icon (Apps/Proctor/Proctor.icns absent) — generic in the consent dialog and Finder; flagged, not blocking.
- 2026-08-13 whats-left follow-through (reader's clarifying answers): README updated to document all 19 tools (was 11) + new capture options. **Repo is no longer local-only** — pushed public to `fledgeling-co/proctor-mcp` (secret-scanned clean; private `docs/status/` gitignored). Marketing site published via GitHub Pages Actions workflow (deploy green) with custom domain `proctor-mcp.fledgeling.app` (DNS CNAME added on Namecheap → fledgeling-co.github.io, mirroring the existing mcp-router record). Awaiting DNS propagation + cert; a background watcher enforces HTTPS when live. Still open: `notarise-now` (needs ASC key) — until then the site's download CTA is a dead end for anyone but the signing machine.
- 2026-08-13 whats-left ingest: reader answered the 6 status-page questions. Only actioned answer was `deferred → all-three` (enables-planning): the three deferred children promoted to backlog briefs PRO-0011/0012/0013 + ledger rows (Last allocated 10→13). The other answers are blocked or unconfirmed — rebuild-signed / notarise / publish are all blocksAutomation:true (need the reader's hands, Apple creds, outward confirmation); git-remote came back `as-found` (not confirmed). None acted on. Domain in notes is spelled inconsistently (proctor-mcp vs procter-mcp). No git remote created; main stays local-only.
- 2026-08-13 FLEET COMPLETE. All 10 features merged to local main @ d237361; 19 tools, 169 tests / 23 suites green. PRO-0010 runner mis-wrote to the main path first, self-detected via empty worktree diff, and relocated cleanly via git stash (verified: main clean, no residual stash, branch held the full diff). All worktrees + ai/* branches removed.
- 2026-08-13 batch 4 launched (final): PRO-0010 off bd3a08c.
- 2026-08-13 batch 3 MERGED to main (bd3a08c): PRO-0006 (capture normalize), PRO-0007 (proctor_zoom), PRO-0009 (proctor_kill + FSJail). Wire.CaptureResult carries both normalization+crop; count 17->19; 157 tests / 22 suites green. Worktrees+branches cleaned.
- 2026-08-13 batch 3 launched (3-concurrent): PRO-0006, PRO-0007, PRO-0009 off 07d7ea3. PRO-0010 queued for batch 4.
- 2026-08-13 batch 2 MERGED to main (07d7ea3): PRO-0003 (proctor_menu), PRO-0004 (proctor_dictionary), PRO-0005 (proctor_policy). Three tool specs split apart in ToolCatalogue; count 14->17; 118 tests / 18 suites green. Worktrees+branches cleaned.
- 2026-08-13 batch 2 launched (3-concurrent): PRO-0003, PRO-0004, PRO-0005 in worktrees off 670389b.
- 2026-08-13 batch 1 MERGED to main (670389b): PRO-0001 (14 tools), PRO-0002 (set-of-marks), PRO-0008 (proctor_resource). Shared-file conflicts (ToolCatalogue/Dispatch/Session/Tests) hand-resolved by union; worktrees+branches cleaned; .worktrees/ gitignored and de-polluted. 82 tests / 13 suites green.
- 2026-08-13 pre-triage complete: 10 specs written, all Ready for Plan; LEDGER Last allocated: 10.
- 2026-08-13 baseline committed (8430fd9); site self-hosted its JS (48447f4); scaffold created.
