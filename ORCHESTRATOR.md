# ORCHESTRATOR — Proctor remaining-work plan & ledger

**Status:** Running
**Updated:** 2026-08-13 — batch 3 MERGED (PRO-0006/0007/0009); worktrees cleaned. main @ bd3a08c, 157 tests / 22 suites green, 19 tools. Launching batch 4 (final): PRO-0010.

## How to resume
You are the fleet orchestrator (ship-fleet skill). Read this file top to bottom, reconcile
the ledger below against reality (`docs/feature-specs/LEDGER.md`, `docs/specs/*`,
`git worktree list`, merged branches), correct drifted rows, then continue filling slots. Rules:
- ≤ **3** concurrent runners (user-chosen, 2026-08-13); an item starts only when every "Depends on" ID has **MERGED**.
- Runners are Opus agents (launched via the verified single-agent-Workflow lane, `model:'opus'`,
  `effort:'high'`, `agentType:'claude'`) that invoke the ship-feature skill and **STOP BEFORE MERGE**;
  the orchestrator serializes all finalization (rebase → gate → merge → worktree cleanup) one branch at a time.
- **This repo has no git remote — `main` is LOCAL-ONLY. "Merge" means merge to local `main`; never push.**
- Serial-only shared writes: `LEDGER.md` (id allocation, done), this file (orchestrator is sole writer),
  the `Sources/` tool catalogue (all items touch it → serialize at merge), integration-branch merges.

### Swift adaptation (this repo is NOT a Diolog web app)
- `proctor-mcp` is a **Swift Package**. The acceptance gate is **`swift build` + `swift test`** (new tests
  per acceptance clause), NOT Playwright e2e.
- **Skip** ship-feature's web-only stages: design-craft/DESIGN.md, `design/mocks/html`, mockup-fidelity,
  Playwright acceptance-e2e. There is **no customer-facing UI**; every feature is backend MCP/AX/AppleEvents/SCK work.
- Best-practices context (no CODING_PRACTICES.md here): `README.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and the existing
  `Sources/ProctorCore` / `ProctorReflector` patterns are the engineering authority.
- Verification is NOT dropped — it is Swift-shaped: typed acceptance evidence = a red→green `swift test`
  per acceptance clause, plus the affected-test sweep. Never ship "verified by code reading".

### External model CLIs
- `external-model-clis: off` — the Codex `gpt-5.6-sol` lane (executor + the three out-of-family review gates)
  is **unavailable on this machine** (relay down). Every gate and executor slice runs **in-family** with a
  **logged downgrade** in the artifact/ledger. This is a **correct** run, not degraded — do NOT burn attempts
  probing Codex. (Recorded as the repo opt-out so any in-flight runner's grep honours it.)

## Wave plan
Wave 1 (no unmerged internal deps — 8 slots): PRO-0001 CUA façade, PRO-0002 set-of-marks, PRO-0003 menu-bar
  shortcuts, PRO-0004 app-dictionary, PRO-0005 audit+policy, PRO-0006 capture-normalisation, PRO-0007 zoom,
  PRO-0008 MCP-surface.
Wave 2 (after their dep merges): PRO-0009 process-kill+fs-jail (soft after PRO-0008 — annotation/gating
  conventions), PRO-0010 pointer-overlay (after PRO-0002 — shared overlay path).
Holding pen (external deps / needs input): none.
