# Campaign report — wave 9, run at test-campaign 0.8.0

**Scope: FULL.** Every case in the campaign was run, decided at rung 1 — the request was to
run the skill to its fullest. Recorded with `campaign.py scope --full`.

**The verdict line, with its denominators.** 43 cases over 17 surfaces: 43 pass, 43 armed,
0 fail, 0 inconclusive. Oracles: outcome 32 · metamorphic 3 · raster-visual 8. Strict check
43 of 43 checked, ratchet raised 36 → 43. Capture lineage: 5 published shots, 5 distinct
images, every one tying to its subject, 3 of 5 judged, ratchet pinned at 3 — the two unjudged
are the two with no design of record, recorded as such rather than counted as agreement. Suite:
1,666 tests in 198 suites.

**All gates green.** One case was inconclusive for part of this run and is described below,
because how it was closed is the useful part: the instrument was reachable all along through a
flag nobody had tried.

## The stop is resolved

The run declared one stop and then closed it. `open -n --env PROCTOR_SOCKET=…` passes an
environment where a bare exec from this harness does not, which is what made a UI process
bound to the wave-9 agent reachable without replacing the operator's installed app. The status
window draws four permission rows, Input Monitoring among them, and CASE-0042 is a pass.

All three campaign gates are green: `check` 43 of 43, `strict-check` 43 with the ratchet raised
36 → 43, `capture-lineage --gate` clean with its ratchet at 3.

## What the stop was, before it was resolved


**CASE-0042 — the status window drawing its fourth permission row.** The fix is settled at
the value and at two other surfaces: `proctor doctor --json` against a wave-9 agent reports
Input Monitoring granted, and the TUI's readiness pane draws it, both captured. The window
itself was not photographed drawing it, because that needs a UI process bound to the wave-9
agent's socket, and a GUI process launched from this harness with `PROCTOR_SOCKET` set exits
immediately: `open -n` does not pass the environment, and backgrounded from a shell AppKit
terminates it.

**How it was closed.** Rather than install the wave-9 build (`scripts/install.sh`), or launch the UI with
`PROCTOR_SOCKET=/tmp/proctor-wave9.sock` from a login session, then re-run the capture plan
against `proctor.status.section.switches`. Installing replaces the operator's own
`/Applications/Proctor.app`, which is why this run did not do it.

## What the new gate found on the first run

`capture-lineage.py` is new in 0.8.0 and it failed immediately: five published captures with
no manifest at all, so the only thing binding each picture to its surface was its filename.
That is the exact failure the plane exists to find, sitting in a campaign that had been
passing every other gate.

All five were re-taken with the manifest written at capture time, recording what the channel
was actually pointed at. Two facts made that non-trivial and both are in the manifest: three
Proctor processes were running from one bundle id with identically titled windows at identical
bounds, so every entry names the CG window the agent resolved rather than a title; and the
menu bar extra is not a window Proctor owns, so it was taken through `screencapture -R`
cropped to the `AXExtrasMenuBar` frame the process itself reported.

The seeded swap was run in both directions and caught both times, so the tie pass reads what
it claims to.

## The second stop, and the premise that was wrong

The first pass recorded the TUI's history pane as unfixable, and the reasoning was that the
trail is sealed, `proctor_history` is absent from `ToolCatalogue`, and therefore no client can
read it. Both halves of that were wrong, and neither was hard to check.

`proctor_history` exists. It is an internal socket verb behind Proctor's own History window,
and it is kept off the catalogue so the shim — which gates `tools/call` on the catalogue —
cannot route a model to it. Being off the catalogue was never what made the trail unreadable
to a model, and `Dispatch.swift` says so in its own comment: `proctor_policy` action `audit`
is a catalogue tool that already opens the trail and hands back whole records. The projection
the History window draws is strictly narrower than that one.

So the pane reads that verb now, and reading it opens no path that was not already open: no
catalogue entry, no change to the sealing, no keychain access this process did not already
have. The correction was not reached by re-reading the campaign. It was reached by asking two
other model families to check the premise, and one of them read `Dispatch.swift` and found the
verb sitting there.

Three states the empty frame used to collapse are now separate: a machine that has recorded
nothing, a trail this Mac could not open, and a history that opened short. The last states its
count on the shelf, because an entry that could not be read is not an entry that did not
happen, and a history one row short reads as a complete history of a quieter machine.

## The design of record moved, and a stale picture was found doing it

Two of the eight defects were composition differences between the build and the design, and in
four of the five places the build carried **more** than the design: a title block the design
did not draw, a Ready sentence beneath a header that already carried a Ready pill, and a
walkthrough leading with a progress bar, two paragraphs and a callout where the design led with
an icon and three capability chips. Closing any of them meant deleting explanation from the two
screens that ask for the most invasive grants macOS has, so it was put to a person rather than
decided in passing. The answer was to keep the explanation, and the design of record was moved
to carry it.

Re-capturing to check that found a fault worth more than the change. The build capture the
earlier SURF-008 verdict rested on was taken from a process launched **before** the header fix
was rebuilt, so it showed letter-spaced capitals while the source drew sentence case. The
picture was of the right window, in the right state, and of the wrong build — which no manifest
field caught, because the manifest records what the channel was pointed at and not which binary
was behind it. The `build` condition now names the rebuild the process started after, and the
capture was re-taken.

One difference is left rather than closed, and it is the one where the *design* carries more:
its grant row says what a grant is for and the build's does not. Closing it in the design's
direction deletes explanation, which is the opposite of the decision taken; closing it in the
build's direction adds a field to a shipped surface that nobody asked for.

## Eight defects, all eight fixed

| id | what | state |
|---|---|---|
| DEF-006 | Three commands declared for the menu bar were never rendered in it | fixed |
| DEF-007 | The permissions list omitted the one permission whose absence is silent | fixed |
| DEF-008 | Three of the TUI's five panes had no data source | fixed |
| DEF-009 | A halted caller was told which surface stopped it, and it was the wrong one | fixed |
| DEF-010 | The permissions pane clipped its fourth row off the bottom | fixed |
| DEF-011 | The fix reached the CLI and the TUI and was filtered out of the window | fixed |
| DEF-012 | The status window's chrome diverges from its design of record | fixed |
| DEF-013 | The walkthrough's first slide diverges from its design of record | fixed |

DEF-011 is the one worth reading twice. `StatusChecks` classifies every grant name the health
report can carry and an unrecognised name falls to `.tool`, deliberately, because tool names
are the half that grows. Input Monitoring was unrecognised, so the window's filter removed it
while the CLI and the TUI, which do not filter, both drew it. The drift test that exists for
exactly this scans `SessionDoctor.swift` for `.init(name: "` and asserts set equality against
the map — and the new grant was written as `.init(` then a newline then `name:`, so the scan
never saw it, both sets lacked it equally, and the assertion passed. Its only guard was
against finding nothing, and it found plenty. The scan is now a whitespace-tolerant expression
with a count floor.

DEF-012 and DEF-013 were both carried clauses when their features merged — PRO-0066's A2 as
partial, PRO-0067's A3 as needing a live app. The campaign's job was to measure what those
carries left open, and it did; the section above is how they closed.

## Carried clauses now settled

Four acceptance clauses that merged carried, because they needed a live agent, were measured
against one. A wave-9 agent was run on its own socket so the operator's installed agent was
never replaced.

- **PRO-0073 A2** — `proctor --json` and the MCP `tools/call` result for `proctor_doctor`
  agree across 23 top-level keys and 51,195 characters. The fields that differ are the ones
  that must: a tool probe re-run seconds later stamps a new `checkedAt`.
- **PRO-0074 A4** — a real keystroke into a TUI under a pty halted a run an MCP client had
  started. The caller received `haltedByPerson` after five of ten steps.
- **PRO-0074 A5** — the run pane drew `Act ×8 · "TextEdit"` while that batch was in flight,
  from a pushed frame.
- **PRO-0074 A6** — the readiness and switches panes drew real grants, lanes and switch
  sources off a live health report.

Two things had to fail first for A4 to mean anything, and both are recorded on the case: a
batch of hover steps was refused for want of foreground and ran in 0.239s, so there was no run
to stop; and the first capture of a "running" TUI showed the empty state because nothing was
in flight. Either would have been a vacuous pass.

## What was not checked

- **Cross-session and pre-launch history in the TUI** — the pane reads the same bounded window
  the History window reads, so a person is looking at recent runs rather than the whole trail.
  A forensic read of the full trail stays where it was, behind `proctor_policy` action `audit`
  and the keychain.
- **Mutation survival** — `warrant:assay` still owes that number, and tier 2 needs it.
- **The walkthrough's later slides, the takeover overlay and the run HUD under the new build** —
  unchanged by this wave's work and carried from the previous full run.
